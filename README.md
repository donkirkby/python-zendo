# Python Zendo
### Can you find the secret program?

This project will be a Python programming game based on the [Zendo] board game
by [Kory Heath] and published by Looney Labs. Each round, the moderator will
write a small Python program to determine whether each input matches a secret
rule, and then the players will write inputs. To guess the secret rule, a player
will write another small Python program. The whole thing will run on a web page,
so you don't have to install a Python editor.

If you'd like to see a preview of how to play with Python in your browser, try
my Live Coding [browser demo].

All the code in this project will be released under the MIT license, but the
"Zendo" name and rules are used with the generous permission of Looney Labs and
Kory Heath. Please check with [Looney Labs] before you publish your own version.
